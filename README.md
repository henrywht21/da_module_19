Clustering with Unsupervised ML

This project practices the use of unsupervised learning with k-means to cluster different cryptocurreny types. Initially, a model is created using only the scaled data. The model is improved upon by using feature engineering through PCA. The comparison of the two models is shown at the end of the notebook, and exemplifies the complexity-explainability tradeoff.
